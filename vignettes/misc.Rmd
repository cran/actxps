## Policy duration functions

The `pol_()` family of functions can be used to calculate policy years, months, quarters, weeks, or any other arbitrary duration. Each function accepts a vector of dates and a vector of issue dates.

**Example**: assume a policy was issued on 2022-05-10 and we are interested in calculating various policy duration values at the end of calendar years 2022-2032.

```{r pol-dur1}


dates <- ymd("2022-12-31") + years(0:10)

# policy years
pol_yr(dates, "2022-05-10")

# policy quarters
pol_qtr(dates, "2022-05-10")

# policy months
pol_mth(dates, "2022-05-10")

# policy weeks
pol_wk(dates, "2022-05-10")


```

The more general `pol_interval()` function can be used to calculate any arbitrary duration. This function has a third argument where the length of the policy duration can be specified. This argument must be a period object. See `lubridate::period()` for more information.

```{r pol-dur2}

# days
pol_interval(dates, "2022-05-10", days(1))

# fortnights
pol_interval(dates, "2022-05-10", weeks(2))

```
